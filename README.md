# Project Overview

This project investigates the impact of OPEC oil prices on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the maritime transportation sector across European countries from 1995 to 2020. By analyzing panel data, the study explores the relationship between oil prices and GHG emissions while considering the varying levels of oil dependency among countries.

# Structure

Article.pdf: Contains the detailed research paper with findings, methodology, and data analysis.
Code: Includes Python and R scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Data: The dataset includes variables such as oil consumption, GDP, GHG emissions, and oil prices.

# The study reveals that:

Dependent countries tend to increase GHG emissions when OPEC oil prices rise, as they switch to more polluting energy sources.
Independent countries reduce their GHG emissions due to decreased oil consumption when prices increase.
The results highlight the need for policy interventions to promote cleaner energy alternatives in highly dependent countries.
